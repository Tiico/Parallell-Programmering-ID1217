------- 1000 x 1000 matrix -------
Sequential execution time: 0.00270385

2 cores: 0.00159183 s, speedup = 1.70

3 cores: 0.00133778 s, speedup = 2.02

4 cores: 0.00128731 s, speedup = 2.10

The speedup from using parallelism comes when the tasks starts to increase in size. This is because of the overhead that comes with setting up the threads, etc.
